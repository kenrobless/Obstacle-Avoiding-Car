# OBSTACLE AVOIDING CAR
AN INTELLIGENT AUTONOMOUS DEVICE THAT CAN SENSE AND AVOID OBSTACLES THAT ARE INFRONT OF IT BY TURNING ITS DIRECTION. IT CONTAINS OF A MICROCONTROLLER TO PROCESS DATA AND, AN ULTRASONIC SENSOR TO DETECT OBSTACLES ON ITS PATH.

## Features
- DETECTS OBSTACLE ON ITS PATH USING ULTRASAONIC SENSOR;
- IT NAVIGATES IN UNKNOWN ENVIRONMENT TO AVOID COLLISIONS;
- MOTOR DRIVER CONTROLS WHICH MOTOR WILL MOVED OR STOPPED IN ACCORDANCE FROM INCOMING SIGNAL OF MICROCONTROLLER;
- MOVING AND TURNING ITSELF IN ANOTHER ACTION TO AVOID OBSTACLE;
- COMPACT AND LIGHT WEIGHT;
- NARROW ACCPETANCE ANGLE;
